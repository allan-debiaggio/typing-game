# Typing Game :

This needs to be a game similar to Fruit Ninja / Fruit Slicer, in the Pygame library, as a practise exercise.

## Content :

We need to have fruits, ice cubes and bombs : 
- Fruits add points, 
- Ice cubes stops time for 3 to 5 seconds,
- Bombs explode and end the game instantly.
- For each fruit missed you gain a strike, three strikes and the game is over.
- Cutting more than one fruit at once with the same letter gives a combo,
- Final score corresponds to number of fruits sliced during the game.
For example, +1 for a sliced fruit, +2 for three fruits at once, +3 for four fruits at once and so on.

## More to do : 

Personnalize your game to the max for a better user experience. Sounds, music... 
Give the player the chance to select a difficulty level (spawn frequency, number of fruits...)
and / or a multilingual support through game menu
